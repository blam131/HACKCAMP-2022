Quotability

Sometimes we all need a bit of motivation to start the day.
Quotability is a Google Chrome extension that replaces your new tab with an inspirational quote.
Users can submit their own inspirational quotes and like the quotes of other users. 
A profanity filter is in place to prevent users from submitting harmful quotes with profane language.
Users can access a leaderboard with the most liked quotes from users. 
An algorithm that accounts for quotes that are well liked by others and for how recent the quote is ensures that users will be seeing the most relevant quotes.
